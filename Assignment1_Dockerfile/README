To Build Docker Image from Docker file using the following command:

$ docker build -t <image_name> .
Example:
$ docker build -t tmp .
(tmp = Tomcat.MongoDB,Python27)

Or if you have named Dockerfile to something else like testfile, then use following command:

$ docker build -t tmp -f testfile .

Once the image is ready you can check with:
$ docker images

Creating a container with Docker Image

$ docker run -d  -p 7080:8080 -p 27017:27017 tmp
This will run the Tomcat on 7080 on localhost and MongoDB on 27017

You can check the tomcat by running the following URL in brower:

http://localhost:7080

And you can check the MongoDB using nc command:

$ nc -vz localhost 27017

For Python, you need to enter the container:

$ docker exec -it <conatiner_name> /bin/bash

Once entered, run the following command to check the Python Version

$ python -V
